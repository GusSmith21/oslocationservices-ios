The `OSAnnotation` protocol is used with OSAnnotationView to add annotations to an OSMapView.

To use this protocol, adopt it in classes which represent points of interest.
A class that adopts this protocol must implement the coordinate property.

For simple use cases, consider using OSPointAnnotation instead of defining a new class.
