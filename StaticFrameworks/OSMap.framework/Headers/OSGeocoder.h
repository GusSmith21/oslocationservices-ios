/**
 OSGeocoder provides an interface to lookup positions based on place names, postcodes, grid references, roads, or any 
 combination thereof.
 
 It operates on either/both an offline database which is provided with the SDK or Ordnance Survey online services

 OSGeocoder is not thread-safe, and is not reentrant. It must only be called from a single thread, and only one geocoding 
 operation can be run at any one time. Clients should use cancelGeocode to cancel online searches, and not issue requests 
 while isGeocoding returns YES.
 
 
 The search always returns a (possibly empty) array of objects derived from OSPlacemark objects. Any matching roads are 
 returned as OSRoad objects.
 
 A search of type OSGeocodeTypeOnlinePostcode or OSGeocodeTypeOnlineGazetteer will use the appropriate Ordnance Survey 
 online service to fetch results. 

 A search of type OSGeocodeTypeGazetteer will return matching place names. These will be ordered by the type of place; 
 Cities will be returned before Towns, and Towns before other features.
 
 A search of type OSGeocodeTypeGridReference will treat the search term as an OS Grid Reference. It will return up to one 
 result. A valid search term consists of two letters as per the [OS National Grid Square convention][https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/oswebsite/gps/information/coordinatesystemsinfo/guidetonationalgrid/page9.html] 
 followed by 0,2,4,6,8 or 10 digits. Invalid search terms (not matching this format, or containing invalid letter 
 sequences) will return no results.
 
 A search of type OSGeocodeTypeRoad will return roads matching the search term. If none are found, then the search term 
 will be split into a road and a location.  If a comma is present in the search term, the split will be made there, 
 otherwise the split is carried out automatically. The search will then return roads near matching locations.
 
 OSGeocoder allows searches to be carried out with a range. The behaviour of this range varies.
 
 A search over multiple types (for example Gazetteer and Road) will search for entries of the specified types that
 match the search string. These results will be ordered by result type.
 
 The range field is honoured for searches of type OSGeocodeTypeGazetteer and OSGeocodeTypeRoad, but ignored for all 
 other types of search. A search combining multiple types will honour the range field where it can, but will apply the 
 range individually to each result set, so a combined search with a range of
        (NSRange){0,100} 
 may return 100 gazetteer entries AND 100 roads.

    @param range  specifies number (and offset) of results to return. This will be applied individually to each

    Callbacks for offline searches will be made synchronously, while callbacks for online searches will be made asynchronously on the caller thread. A search which comprises both offline

    If no results are found, completionHandler will be called once (even for combiend offline/online searches) with a non-nil error indicating the problem. 
 
    The completionHandler MUST NOT start a search before returning if the error is OSGeocoderErrorCancelled.
