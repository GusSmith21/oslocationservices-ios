 If you return YES from this method, Core Location displays the heading calibration alert on top of the current window immediately. The calibration alert prompts the user to move the device in a particular pattern so that Core Location can distinguish between the Earthâ€™s magnetic field and any local magnetic fields. The alert remains visible until calibration is complete or until you explicitly dismiss it by calling the dismissHeadingCalibrationDisplay method. In the latter case, you can use this method to set up a timer and dismiss the interface after a specified amount of time has elapsed.
